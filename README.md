# hello-world
Just say hello to the world.
Hello, welcome to my world.I'm a novelist and I've been living for thousands of years. 
I've seen many things happened arround me, that's why I can write extraordinary novels. I have so many unbelievable stories to tell you.
But my memories are fading, I almost forgot the things happened thousands years before.
Oh, forgot to tell you: I'm a cat with eight tails.
